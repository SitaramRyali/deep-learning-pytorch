# Generate TV Scripts
Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree `TV Script generation` project 

#Introduction:
In this project, I will generate your own TV scripts using RNNs, LSTM's.
I'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. 
The Neural Network I'll build will generate a new funny unseen TV script.
